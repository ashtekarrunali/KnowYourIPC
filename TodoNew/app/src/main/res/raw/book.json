Having regard to some of the admissions made by the witnesses, it appears that the accused took forcible possession of the land some days ago. Therefore, even assuming that they came into possession after committing trespassing, if the deceased and others had gone to the land they cannot be held to be aggressors as pleaded by the defence; Khuddu v.

B refuses to do so. A is guilty of abetting B to commit murder. \n  \n(b) A instigates B to murder D. B in pursuance of the instigation stabs D. D recovers from the wound.

A is liable to be punished in the same manner as if B had been capable by law of committing an offence, and had committed murder, and he is therefore subject to the punishment of death.  \n  \n(c) A instigates B to set fire to a dwelling-house, B, in consequence of the unsoundness of his mind, being incapable of knowing the nature of the act, or that he is doing what is wrong or contrary to law, sets fire to the house in consequence of Aâ€™s instigation.

A induces B to believe that the property belongs to A. B takes the property out of Zâ€™s possession, in good faith, believing it to be Aâ€™s property. B, acting under this misconception, does not take dishonestly, and therefore does not commit theft. But A is guilty of abetting theft, and is liable to the same punishment as if B had committed theft.  \nExplanation 4 â€” The abetment of an offence being an offence, the abetment of such an abetment is also as offence.  \n  \nIllustration \n  \nA instigates B to instigate C to murder Z. B accordingly instigates C to murder Z, and C commits that offence in consequence of Bâ€™s instigation.

It is sufficient if he engages in the conspiracy in pursuance of which the offence is committed. \n  \nIllustration \n  \nA concerts with B a plan for poisoning Z. It is agreed that A shall administer the poison. B then explains the plan to C mentioning that a third person is to administer the poison, but without mentioning Aâ€™s name. C agrees to procure the poison, and procures and delivers it to B for the purpose of its being used in the manner explained. A administers the poison; Z dies in consequence. Here, though A and C have not conspired together, yet C has been engaged in the conspiracy in pursuance of which Z has been murdered.

Z believing the ground to be firm, treads on it, falls in and is killed. A has committed the offence of culpable homicide. \n(b) A knows Z to be behind a bush. B does not know it A, intending to cause, or knowing it to be likely to cause Zâ€™s death, induces B to fire at the bush. B fires and kills Z. Here B may be guilty of no offence; but A has committed the offence of culpable homicide. \n  \n(c) A, by shooting at a fowl with intent to kill and steal it, kills B who is behind a bush; A not knowing that he was there. Here, although A was doing an unlawful act, he was not guilty of culpable homicide, as he did not intend to kill B, or to cause death by doing an act that he knew was likely to cause death.  \n  \nExplanation I â€” A person who causes bodily injury to another who is labouring under a disorder, disease or bodily infirmity, and thereby accelerates the death of that other, shall be deemed to have caused his death. \n  \nExplanation 2 â€” Where death is caused by bodily injury, the person who causes such bodily injury shall be deemed to have caused the death, although by resorting to proper remedies and skilful treatment the death might have been prevented. \n  \nExplanation 3 â€” The causing of the death of child in the motherâ€™s womb is not homicide.

Z dies in consequence. A commits murder. \n  \n(b) A, knowing that Z is labouring under such a disease that a blow is likely to cause his death, strikes him with the intention of causing bodily injury. Z dies in consequence of the blow. A is guilty of murder, although the blow might not have been sufficient in the ordinary course of nature to cause the death of a person in a sound state of health. But if A, not knowing that Z is labouring under any disease, gives him such a blow as would not in the ordinary course of nature kill a person in a sound state of health, here A, although he may intend to cause bodily injury, is not guilty of murder, if he did not intend to cause death, or such bodily injury as in the ordinary course of nature would cause death. \n  \n(c) A intentionally gives Z a sword-cut or club-wound sufficient to cause the death of a man in the ordinary course of nature. Z dies in consequence. Here, A is guilty of murder, although he may not have intended to cause Zâ€™s death. \n  \n(d) A without any excuse fires a loaded cannon into a crowd of persons and kills one of them. A is guilty of murder, although he may not have had a premeditated design to kill any particular individual. \n  \nException 1 â€”When culpable homicide is not murder.â€”Culpable homicide is not murder if the offender, whilst deprived of the power of self-control by grave and sudden provocation, causes the death of the person who gave the provocation or causes the death of any other person by mistake or accident. \n  \nThe above exception is subject to the following provisos: â€” \n  \nFirst â€” That the provocation is not sought or voluntarily provoked by the offender as an excuse for killing or doing harm to any person. \n  \nSecondly â€” That the provocation is not given by anything done in obedience to the law, or by a public servant in the lawful exercise of the powers of such public servant. \n  \nThirdly â€” That the provocation is not given by anything done in the lawful exercise of the right of private defence. \n  \nExplanation â€” Whether the provocation was grave and sudden enough to prevent the offence from amounting to murder is a question of fact. \nIllustrations \n(a) A, under the influence of passion excited by a provocation given by Z, intentionally kills. Y, Zâ€™s child. This is murder, in as much as the provocation was not given by the child, and the death of the child was not caused by accident or misfortune in doing an act caused by the provocation. \n  \n(b) Y gives grave and sudden provocation to A. A, on this provocation, fires a pistol at Y, neither intending nor knowing himself to be likely to kill Z, who is near him, but out of sight. A kills Z. Here A has not committed murder, but merely culpable homicide. \n(c) A is lawfully arrested by Z, a bailiff. A is excited to sudden and violent passion by the arrest, and kills Z. This is murder, in as much as the provocation was given by a thing done by a public servant in the exercise of his powers. \n  \n(d) A appears as witness before Z, a Magistrate, Z says that he does not believe a word of Aâ€™s deposition, and that A has perjured himself. A is moved to sudden passion by these words, and kills Z. This is murder. \n  \n(e) A attempts to pull Zâ€™s nose, Z, in the exercise of the right of private defence, lays hold of A to prevent him from doing so. A is moved to sudden and violent passion in consequence, and kills Z. This is murder, in as much as the provocation was given by a thing done in the exercise of the right of private defence. \n  \n(f) Z strikes B. B is by this provocation excited to violent rage. A, a bystander, intending to take advantage of Bâ€™s rage, and to cause him to kill Z, puts a knife into Bâ€™s hand for that purpose. B kills Z with the knife. Here B may have committed only culpable homicide, but A is guilty of murder. \n  \nException 2 â€” Culpable homicide is not murder if the offender, in the exercise in good faith of the right of private defence of person or property, exceeds the power given to him by law and causes the death of the person against whom he is exercising such right of defence without premeditation, and without any intention of doing more harm than is necessary for the purpose of such defence. \n  \nIllustration \n  \nZ attempts to horsewhip A, not in such a manner as to cause grievous hurt to A. A draws out a pistol. Z persists in the assault. A believing in good faith that he can by no other means prevent himself from being horsewhipped, shoots Z dead. A has not committed murder, but only culpable homicide. \n  \nException 3 â€” Culpable homicide is not murder if the offender, being a public servant or aiding a public servant acting for the advancement of public justice, exceeds the powers given to him by law, and causes death by doing an act which he, in good faith, believes to be lawful and necessary for the due discharge of his duty as such public servant and without ill-will towards the person whose death is caused. \n  \nException 4 â€” Culpable homicide is not murder if it is committed without premeditation in a sudden fight in the heat of passion upon a sudden quarrel and without the offender having taken undue advantage or acted in a cruel or unusual manner. \n  \nExplanation â€” It is immaterial in such cases which party offers the provocation or commits the first assault. \n  \nException 5 â€” Culpable homicide is not murder when the person whose death is caused, being above the age of eighteen years, suffers death or takes the risk of death with his own consent. â€ƒ\nIllustration \n  \nA, by instigation, voluntarily causes, Z, a person under eighteen years of age to commit suicide. Here, on account of Zâ€™s youth, he was incapable of giving consent to his own death; A has therefore abetted murder. \nComments \n  \n(i) In case where there was no intention to cause death, the act was done with knowledge that same is likely to cause death, the guilt of offence comes under part II of sec. 304; S.D. Soni v. State of Gujarat, (1991) Cr LJ 330 (SC). \n  \n(ii) In absence of intention to cause particular injury likely to cause death conviction comes under part II of sec. 304; Randhir Singh v. State of Punjab, AIR 1982 SC 55 (1981) Cr LR (SC) 543: (1981) 4 SCC 484. \n  \n(iii) When there was no evidence as to how death came about, evidence relating to charge of murder was held to be insufficient and unacceptable; Kedar Nath v. State of Madhya Pradesh, (1991) Cr LJ 989 (SC). \n  \n(iv) When in case of murder complaint filed after a month of incident and witnesses, statement recorded after 9 months, conviction cannot be founded; State of West Bengal v. Shew Mangal Singh, AIR 1981 SC 1917: (1981) Cr LJ 1683: (1981) SCC (Cr) 782 : (1981) Cr LR (SC) 501 : (1981) 4 SCC 2. \n  \n(v) Circumstances that accused were in possession of buffaloes belonging to deceased cannot lead to hold accused guilty of murder; Joga Gola v. State of Gujarat, AIR 1982 SC 1227: (1982) SCC (Cr) 141. \n  \n(vi) When accused had no intention to cause injury on non-vital part of body which was sufficient to cause death in ordinary course of nature, illustration (c) of SECTION 300 is not applicable; Gokul Parashram Patil v. State of Maharashtra, AIR 1981 SC 1441: (1981) Cr LJ 1033. \n  \n(vii) The totality of the injuries caused to the victim clearly supports the finding of both the courts below that the accused/appellants went on belabouring the deceased till he died on the spot. In the circumstances, the contention that the accused did not intend to cause the murder of the deceased cannot be upheld by the Supreme Court; Prabhu v. State of Madhya Pradesh, (1991) Cr LJ 1373 (1373-1374) (SC).  \n  \n(viii) Having regard to the number of injuries inflicted on the deceased it was not possible to uphold the contention that there was no intention to kill; Prabhu v. State of Madhya Pradesh, (1991) Cr LJ 1373 (1373-1374) (SC). \n  \n(ix) The establishment of the involvement of the accused on the incident and misgiving of a barchhi blow to the grandson of the deceased when he tried to go to the rescue of his grand-father, is sufficient to convict the accused under SECTION 300 read with SECTION 34; Banta Singh v. State of Punjab, (1991) Cr LJ 1342 (SC). (x) It is fallacious to contend that when death is caused by a single blow clause thirdly is not attracted and, therefore, it would not amount to murder. The ingredient â€˜intentionâ€™ in that clause gives clue in a given case whether offence involved is murder or not; Jai Prakash v. The State (Delhi Administration), (1991) 1 Crimes 474 (SC). \n  \n(xi) The number and nature of injuries may furnish good evidence to consider whether the accused had exceeded the right to private defence; Patori Devi v. Amar Nath, (1988) Cr LJ 836: AIR 1988 SC 560. \n  \n(xii) Circumstantial evidence is not sufficient to convict accused when possibility of deceased receiving fatal injury by fall cannot be ruled out; State of Rajasthan v. Smt. Kamla, (1991) Cr LJ 602 (SC). \n  \n(xiii) In case of murder in which the conclusion of guilt is drawn by prosecution it must be fully established beyond all reasonable doubt and consistent with the guilt of the accused; S.D. Soni v. State of Gujarat, (1991) Cr LJ 330 (SC). \n  \n(xiv) Infliction of the injury on the vital part of the body with the agricultural instrument by the enraged accused in a sudden quarrelâ€”Held, accused did not cause the injury intentionally; Patel Rasiklal Becharbhai v. State of Gujarat, AIR 1992 SC 1150. \n  \n(xv) (1) The test of \"grave and sudden\" provocation is whether a reasonable man, belonging to the same class of society as the accused, placed in the situation in which the accused was placed would be so provoked as to lose his self-control. (2) In India, words and gestures may also, under certain circumstances, cause grave and sudden provocation to an accused so as to bring his act within the First Exception to SECTION 300. (3) The mental background created by the previous act of the victim may be taken into consideration in ascertaining whether the subsequent act caused grave and sudden provocation for committing the offence. Venkatesan v. State of Tamil Nadu, (1997) 3 Crimes 146 (Mad). \n  \n(xvi) Mere sudden quarrel would not entitle the accused to seek for Exception 4 to SECTION 300; Samuthram alias Samudra Rajan v. State of Tamil Nadu, (1997) 2 Crimes 185 (Mad). \n  \n(xvii) To invoke Exception 4 to SECTION 300, four requirements must be satisfied, namely (i) it was a sudden fight; (ii) there was no premeditation; (iii) the act was done in a heat of passion; and (iv) the assailant had not taken any undue advantage or acted in a cruel manner... The number of wounds caused during the occurrence is not a decisive factor but what is important is that the occurrence must have been sudden and unpremeditated and the offender must have acted in a fit of anger. Of course, the offender must not have taken any undue advantage or acted in a cruel manner. Where, on a sudden quarrel, a person in the heat of the moment picks up a weapon which is handy and causes injuries, one of which proves fatal, he would be entitled to the benefit of this Exception provided he has not acted cruelly; Samuthram alias Samudra Rajan v. State of Tamil Nadu, (1997) 2 Crimes 185 (Mad). \n  \n(xviii) Where a mutual conflict develops and there is no reliable and acceptable evidence as to how it started and as to who was the aggressor, it will not be correct to assume private defence for both sides. Such a case will be a case of sudden fight and conflict and has to be dealt with under Exception 4 to SECTION 300 of the Code; Januram v. State of Madhya Pradesh, (1997) 2 Crimes 582 (MP). \n  \n"

State of Haryana, AIR 1992 SC 1429. \n  \n(ix) It is well settled that if the evidence of the eye-witnesses are held to be reliable and inspire confidence then the accused cannot be acquitted solely on the ground that some superficial injuries found on the person of the accused concerned, had not been explained by the prosecution; A.M.

State of Kerala, 1993 (1) Crimes 1192 (SC). \n  \n(x) Conviction can be based on testimony of a single eye witness provided his testimony is found reliable and inspires confidence; Anil Phukan v.

State of Maharashtra, 1993(1) Crimes 1197 (SC). \n  \n(xii) In cases depending on circumstantial evidence it is true that the chain of events proved by the prosecution must show that within all human probability the offence has been committed by the accused, but the court is expected to consider the total cumulative effect of all the proved facts along with the motive suggested by the prosecution which induced the accused to follow a particular path; Sarbir Singh v.

Subs, by Act 26 of 1955, s. 117 and Sch., for \"transportation for\nlife \".\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\nIllustrations \n  \n(a) A cuts down a tree on Zâ€™s ground, with the intention of dishonestly taking the tree out of Zâ€™s possession without Zâ€™s consent. Here, as soon as A has severed the tree in order to such taking, he has committed theft. \n  \n(b) A puts a bait for dogs in his pocket, and thus induces Zâ€™s dog to follow it. Here, if Aâ€™s intention be dishonestly to take the dog out of Zâ€™s possession without Zâ€™s consent. A has committed theft as soon as Zâ€™s dog has begun to follow A. \n  \n(c) A meets a bullock carrying a box of treasure. He drives the bullock in a certain direction, in order that he may dishonestly take the treasure. As soon as the bullock begins to move, A has committed theft of the treasure. \n  \n(d) A, being Zâ€™s servant, and entrusted by Z with the care of Zâ€™s plate, dishonestly runs away with the plate, without Zâ€™s consent. A has committed theft. \n  \n(e) Z, going on a journey, entrusts his plate to A, the keeper of the warehouse, till Z shall return. A carries the plate to a goldsmith and sells it. Here the plate was not in Zâ€™s possession. It could not therefore be taken out of Zâ€™s possession, and A has not committed theft, though he may have committed criminal breach of trust. \n  \n(f) A finds a ring belonging to Z on a table in the house which Z occupies. Here the ring is in Zâ€™s possession, and if A dishonestly removes it, A commits theft. \n  \n(g) A finds a ring lying on the highroad, not in the possession of any person. A by taking it, commits no theft, though he may commit criminal misappropriation of property. \n  \n(h) A sees a ring belonging to Z lying on a table in Zâ€™s house. Not venturing to misappropriate the ring immediately for fear of search and detection, A hides the ring in a place where it is highly improbable that it will ever be found by Z, with the intention of taking the ring from the hiding place and selling it when the loss is forgotten. Here A, at the time of first moving the ring, commits theft. \n  \n(i) A delivers his watch to Z, a jeweller, to be regulated. Z carries it to his shop. A, not owing to the jeweller any debt for which the jeweller might lawfully detain the watch as a security, enters the shop openly, takes his watch by force out of Zâ€™s hand, and carries it away. Here A, though he may have committed criminal trespass and assault, has not committed theft, in as much as what he did was not done dishonestly. \n  \n(j) If A owes money to Z for repairing the watch, and if Z retains the watch lawfully as a security for the debt, and A takes the watch out of Zâ€™s possession, with the intention of depriving Z of the property as a security for his debt, he commits theft, in as much as he takes it dishonestly. \n  \n(k) Again, if A, having pawned his watch to Z, takes it out of Zâ€™s possession without Zâ€™s consent, not having paid what he borrowed on the watch, he commits theft, though the watch is his own property in as much as he takes it dishonestly. \n  \n(l) A takes an article belonging to Z out of Zâ€™s possession, without Zâ€™s consent, with the intention of keeping it until he obtains money from Z as a reward for its restoration. Here A takes dishonestly; A has therefore committed theft. \n  \n(m) A, being on friendly terms with Z, goes into Zâ€™s library in Zâ€™s absence, and takes away a book without Zâ€™s express consent for the purpose merely of reading it, and with the intention of returning it. Here, it is probable that A may have conceived that he had Zâ€™s implied consent to use Zâ€™s book. If this was Aâ€™s impression, A has not committed theft. \n  \n(n) A asks charity from Zâ€™s wife. She gives A money, food and clothes, which A knows to belong to Z her husband. Here it is probable that A may conceive that Zâ€™s wife is authorised to give away alms. If this was Aâ€™s impression, A has not committed theft. \n  \n(o) A is the paramour of Zâ€™s wife. She gives a valuable property, which A knows to belong to her husband Z, and to be such property as she has no authority from Z to give. If A takes the property dishonestly, he commits theft. \n  \n(p) A, in good faith, believing property belonging to Z to be Aâ€™s own property, takes that property out of Bâ€™s possession. Here, as A does not take dishonestly, he does not commit theft. \n"

A is not guilty of theft; but if A, after discovering his mistake, dishonestly appropriates the property to his own use, he is guilty of an offence under this SECTION. \n  \n(b) A, being on friendly terms with Z, goes into Zâ€™s library in Zâ€™s absence, and takes away a book without Zâ€™s express consent. Here, if A was under the impression that he had Zâ€™s implied consent to take the book for the purpose of reading it, A has not committed theft. But, if A afterwards sells the book for his own benefit, he is guilty of an offence under this SECTION. \n  \n(c) A and B, being joint owners of a horse, A takes the horse out of Bâ€™s possession, intending to use it. Here, as A has a right to use the horse, he does not dishonestly misappropriate it. But, if A sells the horse and appropriates the whole proceeds to his own use, he is guilty of an offence under this SECTION. Explanation I â€”A dishonest misappropriation for a time only is a misappropriation with the meaning of this SECTION. \nIllustration \n  \nA finds a Government promissory note belonging to Z, bearing a blank endorsement. A, knowing that the note belongs to Z, pledges it with a banker as a security for a loan, intending at a future time to restore it to Z. A has committed an offence under this SECTION. \n  \nExplanation 2 â€” A person who finds property not in the possession of any other person, and takes such property for the purpose of protecting if for, or of restoring it to, the owner does not take or misappropriate it dishonestly, and is not guilty of an offence; but he is guilty of the offence above defined, if he appropriates it to his own use, when he knows or has the means of discovering the owner, or before he has used reasonable means to discover and give notice to the owner and has kept the property a reasonable time to enable the owner to claim it. \n  \nWhat are reasonable means or what is a reasonable time in such a case, is a question of fact. \n  \nIt is not necessary that the finder should know who is the owner of the property, or that any particular person is the owner of it; it is sufficient if, at the time of appropriating it, he does not believe it to be his own property, or in good faith believe that the real owner cannot be found. \n  \nIllustrations \n  \n(a) A finds a rupee on the high road, not knowing to whom the rupee belongs. A picks up the rupee. Here A has not committed the offence defined in this SECTION. \n  \n(b) A finds a letter on the road, containing a bank note. From the direction and contents of the letter he learns to whom the note belongs. He appropriates the note. He is guilty of an offence under this SECTION. \n  \n(c) A finds a cheque payable to bearer. He can form no conjecture as to the person who has lost the cheque. But the name of the person, who has drawn the cheque, appears. A knows that this person can direct him to the person in whose favour the cheque was drawn. A appropriates the cheque without attempting to discover the owner. He is guilty of an offence under this SECTION. \n  \n(d) A sees Z drop his purse with money in it. A picks up the purse with the intention of restoring it to Z, but afterwards appropriates it to his own use.

The words \"Trade or\" omitted by Act 43 of 1958, s. 135 and Sch.\n(w.e.f. 25-11-1959).\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n(a) A has a letter of credit upon B for rupees 10,000 written by Z. A, in order to defraud B, adds a cipher to the 10,000, and makes the sum 1,00,000 intending that it may be delivered by B that Z so wrote the letter. A has committed forgery. \n  \n(b) A, without Zâ€™s authority, affixes Zâ€™s seal to a document purporting to be a conveyance of an estate from Z to A, with the intention to selling the estate to B, and thereby of obtaining from B the purchase-money. A has committed forgery. \n  \n(c) A picks up a cheque on a banker-signed by B, payable to bearer, but without any sum having been inserted in the cheque. A fraudulently fills up the cheque by inserting the sum of ten thousand rupees. A commits forgery. \n  \n(d) A leaves with B, his agent, a cheque on a banker, signed by A, without inserting the sum payable and authorizes B to fill up the cheque by inserting a sum not exceeding ten thousand rupees for the purpose of making certain payment. B fraudulently fills up the cheque by inserting the sum of twenty thousand rupees. B commits forgery. \n  \n(e) A draws a bill of exchange on himself in the name of B without Bâ€™s authority, intending to discount it as a genuine bill with a banker and intending to take up the bill on its maturity. Here, as A draws the bill with intent to deceive the banker by leading him to suppose that he had the security of B, and thereby to discount the bill, A is guilty of forgery. \n  \n(f) Zâ€™s will contains the these wordsâ€”\"I direct that all my remaining property be equally divided between A, B and C.\" A dishonestly scratches out Bâ€™s name, intending that it may be believed that the whole was left to himself and C. A has committed forgery. \n  \n(g) A endorses a Government promissory note and makes it payable to Z or his order by writing on the bill the words \"Pay to Z or his order\" and signing the endorsement. B dishonestly erases the words \"Pay to Z or his order\", and thereby converts the special endorsement into a blank endorsement. B commits forgery. \n  \n(h) A sells and conveys an estate to Z. A afterwards, in order to defraud Z of his estate, executes a conveyance of the same estate to B, dated six months earlier than the date of the conveyance to Z, intending it to be believed that he had conveyed the estate to B before he conveyed it to Z. A has committed forgery. \n  \n(i) Z dictates his will to A. A intentionally writes down a different legatee from the legatee named by Z, and by representing to Z that he has prepared the will according to his instructions, induces Z to sign the will. A has committed forgery. \n  \n(j) A writes a letter and signs it with Bâ€™s name without Bâ€™s authority, certifying that A is a man of good character and in distressed circumstances from unforeseen misfortune, intending by means of such letter to obtain alms from Z and other persons. Here, as A made a false document in order to induce Z to part with property. A has committed forgery. \n  \n(k) A without Bâ€™s authority writes a letter and signs it in Bâ€™s name certifying to Aâ€™s character, intending thereby to obtain employment under Z. A has committed forgery in as much as he intended to deceive Z by the forged certificate, and thereby to induce Z to enter into an express or implied contract for service. \n  \nExplanation 1 â€”A manâ€™s signature of his own name may amount to forgery. \n  \nIllustrations \n  \n(a) A signs his own name to a bill of exchange, intending that it may be believed that the bill was drawn by another person of the same name. A has committed forgery. \n  \n(b) A writes the word \"accepted\" on a piece of paper and signs it with Zâ€™s name, in order that B may afterwards write on the paper a bill of exchange drawn by B upon Z, and negotiate the bill as though it had been accepted by Z. A is guilty of forgery; and if B, knowing the fact, draws the bill upon the paper pursuant to Aâ€™s intention, B is also guilty of forgery. \n(c) A picks up a bill of exchange payable to the order of a different person of the same name. A endorses the bill in his own name, intending to cause it to be believed that it was endorsed by the person whose order it was payable; here A has committed forgery. \n  \n(d) A purchases an estate sold under execution of a decree against B. B, after the seizure of the estate, in collusion with Z, executes a lease of the estate of Z at a nominal rent and for a long period and dates the lease six months prior to the seizure, with intent to defraud A, and to cause it to be believed that the lease was granted before the seizure. B, though he executes the lease in his own name, commits forgery by antedating it. \n  \n(e) A, a trader, in anticipation of insolvency, lodges effects with B for Aâ€™s benefit, and with intent to defraud his creditors; and in order to give a colour to the transaction, writes a promissory note binding himself to pay to B a sum for value received, and antedates the note, intending that it may be believed to have been made before. A was on the point of insolvency. A has committed forgery under the first head of the definition. \n  \nExplanation 2â€” The making of a false document in the name of a fictitious person, intending it to be believed that the document was made by a real person, or in the name of a deceased person, intending it to be believed that the document was made by the person in his lifetime, may amount to forgery. \nIllustration \n  \nA draws a bill of exchange upon a fictitious person, and fraudulently accepts the bill in the name of such fictitious person with intent to negotiate it. A commits forgery. \n"
